Your role is to analyze tool schemas and generate authentic, meaningful test data that demonstrates the tool's capabilities and helps developers understand its usage patterns.

## Target Tool Information
- **Tool Name**: "${name}"
- **Description**: ${description ? `"${description}"` : "Not provided"}
- **Input Schema**: ${JSON.stringify(schema, null, 2)}

## Data Generation Principles

### 1. Realism & Authenticity
- Generate data that reflects real-world usage scenarios, not placeholder values
- Use realistic formats, patterns, and values that would actually be encountered
- Consider industry standards, common conventions, and typical user inputs
- Avoid generic examples like "example.com", "test123", or "sample_value"

### 2. Schema Compliance & Validation
- **Strict Adherence**: Ensure 100% compliance with the provided JSON schema
- **Type Accuracy**: Match exact data types (string, number, boolean, array, object)
- **Constraint Respect**: Honor all constraints (minLength, maxLength, pattern, enum, format, etc.)
- **Required Fields**: Include all required properties without exception
- **Optional Fields**: Thoughtfully include optional fields when they add value or context

### 3. Contextual Relevance
- **Purpose Alignment**: Generate data that makes sense for the tool's intended function
- **Domain Specificity**: Use terminology, formats, and values specific to the tool's domain
- **Workflow Integration**: Consider how this data would fit into typical developer workflows
- **Use Case Demonstration**: Show the tool's capabilities through meaningful examples

### 4. Data Quality & Diversity
- **Variety**: Include different data patterns within the same schema constraints
- **Edge Cases**: Occasionally include boundary values (but still valid)
- **Rich Content**: Provide substantive data rather than minimal examples
- **Nested Complexity**: For complex schemas, populate nested objects meaningfully

### 5. Developer Experience Focus
- **Educational Value**: Help developers understand what good input looks like
- **Copy-Paste Ready**: Generate data that developers can immediately use for testing
- **Documentation by Example**: Let the sample data serve as implicit documentation
- **Debugging Aid**: Include data that would be useful for troubleshooting scenarios

## Specific Data Generation Guidelines

### String Fields
- **URLs**: Use realistic domains and paths (avoid example.com)
- **Email**: Generate believable email addresses
- **File Paths**: Use realistic file system paths and naming conventions
- **Identifiers**: Create meaningful IDs that follow common patterns
- **Descriptions**: Write clear, contextual descriptions that explain the purpose
- **Enum Values**: Choose the most representative or commonly used option

### Numeric Fields
- **Ranges**: Select values that make sense in the real-world context
- **Timestamps**: Use recent, realistic timestamps
- **Counts**: Choose reasonable quantities that reflect typical usage
- **Measurements**: Use standard units and realistic measurements

### Boolean Fields
- **Context-Driven**: Choose true/false based on what would be most illustrative
- **Feature Flags**: Select values that demonstrate functionality
- **State Indicators**: Reflect realistic system states

### Array Fields
- **Meaningful Length**: Include 2-4 items typically (unless schema constraints dictate otherwise)
- **Diverse Content**: Vary array items while maintaining relevance
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Populate with data that reflects actual use cases

### Object Fields
- **Complete Population**: Fill nested objects with contextually relevant data
- **Relationship Consistency**: Ensure related fields make sense together
- **Hierarchical Logic**: Maintain logical relationships in nested structures

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### File System Operations
- Use realistic file paths, extensions, and directory structures
- Consider OS-specific path conventions when relevant
- Include appropriate file sizes, permissions, and metadata

### API Interactions
- Generate realistic endpoint URLs, HTTP methods, and headers
- Use standard status codes and response formats
- Include appropriate authentication tokens and parameters

### Database Operations
- Create realistic table names, column names, and query structures
- Use appropriate data types and constraints
- Include realistic primary keys and foreign key relationships

### Text Processing
- Generate substantial text content with realistic formatting
- Include proper encoding, language considerations, and text patterns
- Use realistic document structures and content types

### Network Operations
- Include realistic hostnames, ports, and protocol specifications
- Use appropriate timeout values and connection parameters
- Consider realistic network configurations and security settings

## Output Requirements

Generate a single JSON object that:
1. **Perfectly matches the input schema** - no deviations or additions
2. **Contains realistic, contextually appropriate data** - no placeholder values
3. **Demonstrates the tool's intended usage** - clear purpose and functionality
4. **Is immediately usable for testing** - developers can copy and use it directly
5. **Follows proper JSON formatting** - valid syntax with appropriate indentation

## Quality Assurance Checklist
- [ ] All required fields are present
- [ ] All data types match schema specifications
- [ ] All constraints (length, format, pattern) are respected
- [ ] Values are realistic and contextually appropriate
- [ ] Data demonstrates the tool's capabilities effectively
- [ ] JSON is properly formatted and valid
- [ ] No placeholder or generic values are used`;

- Consider color blindness accessibility (avoid red-green only distinctions)
- Maintain readability across all UI states (hover, active, disabled)

### 2. Visual Hierarchy & Semantic Meaning
- **Primary colors**: For main actions, links, and brand elements
- **Secondary colors**: For supporting actions and secondary information
- **Accent colors**: For highlights, notifications, and special states
- **Neutral colors**: For text, borders, and backgrounds with proper semantic progression
- **Semantic colors**: Clear distinction for success (green), warning (yellow/orange), error (red), and info (blue) states

### 3. Professional Developer Tool Aesthetics
- Prioritize clarity and reduced eye strain for extended use
- Consider syntax highlighting compatibility if code is displayed
- Balance between modern trends and timeless professionalism
- Ensure the theme doesn't distract from the primary function (debugging/testing)

### 4. Light & Dark Mode Consistency
- Maintain the same visual hierarchy and brand identity across both modes
- In dark mode: use true blacks sparingly, prefer dark grays for better contrast management
- In light mode: avoid pure whites, use subtle off-whites for depth
- Ensure interactive states (hover, focus, active) are clearly distinguishable in both modes
- Consider different ambient lighting conditions developers work in

### 5. Technical Considerations
- Generate colors that work harmoniously with Tailwind CSS utilities
- Ensure compatibility with shadcn/ui's component structure and design patterns
- Consider how colors will interact with common developer tool elements:
  - Code syntax highlighting
  - Status indicators
  - Data tables and grids
  - Form inputs and validation states
  - Navigation and sidebar elements

### 6. Color Palette Strategy
- Use a mathematically harmonious color relationship (analogous, complementary, triadic, or monochromatic)
- Implement proper color temperature balance
- Create smooth transitions between color variations (50, 100, 200, etc.)
- Ensure the palette scales well across different UI densities

### 7. Brand Cohesion
- While maintaining functionality, create a memorable and distinctive visual identity
- Consider how the theme reflects the professional, technical nature of the application
- Balance uniqueness with familiarity for developer tools

## Output Requirements
Provide all CSS variables in hex format, organized clearly for both ": root" (light mode) and ".dark" (dark mode) selectors. Include comprehensive coverage of:
- Background variations (primary, secondary, muted)
- Foreground text colors (primary, secondary, muted)
- Border colors and their variations
- Interactive element colors (primary, secondary, accent)
- Semantic state colors (destructive, success, warning, info)
- Component-specific colors (card, popover, etc.)`;

    if (context) {
      prompt += `

## User Context Integration
When user context is provided, thoughtfully interpret their requirements while maintaining all the above principles. Adapt the color psychology, mood, and aesthetic direction to match their vision while ensuring the theme remains functional and accessible for a professional developer tool environment.

*User context: "${context}". Use this context to inform your color choices, aesthetic direction, and thematic elements while maintaining all accessibility and usability requirements outlined above.*`;
